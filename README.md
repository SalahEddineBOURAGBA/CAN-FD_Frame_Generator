# CAN-FD_Frame_Generator_Analyzer
The "frames_generator" library is used to generate CAN 2.0B and CAN FD frames (specific or random).

The "frames_analyzer" library is used to analyse CAN 2.0B and CAN FD frames.

The "embeddedvector" library replaces the "std:vector" library and is independant from std.

The libraries are written with C++11.
