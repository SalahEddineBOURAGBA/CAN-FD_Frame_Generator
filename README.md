# CAN-FD_Frame_Generator

The "frames_generator" library is used to generate CAN 2.0B and CAN FD frames (specific or random).

The "CANFDFrame" class contains the informations of a frame (id, dlc, ...).

The "embeddedvector" class replaces the "std:vector" class and is independant from std.

The libraries are written with C++11.
